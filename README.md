# This project contains a Vector class which can be used to create a 2D or 3D vector, and use different mathematical functions on the vectors

### Currently implemented:
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication with a scalar
- Division by a scalar
- Finding the angle between two Vectors (in degrees)
- Dot product between two Vectors
- Cross product between two Vectors

In addition, the +, -, *, and / operators have been overloaded to work as expected 
the < operator was overloaded to return the angle between two Vectors 
- (vec1<vec2 returns the angle between vec1 and vec2)

There is no error handling implemented aside from the Dot function, which checks that both inputs are 3D vectors
